<h2>These are the ones I watched in 2022.</h2>
<h3>Black panther</h3>
<p>This movie was crazy sharp just like the panther.</p>
<h3>The Uncharted</h3>
<p>This movie was just filled with thieves and how they could know who to betray and who to trust.</p>
<h3>Avengers endgame</h3>
<p>This was the best of the best.<br> Epic fights among the avengers and a galactic monster named "Thanos"
    This guy was insane strong with a Gautlet that can wield the power of 5 Stones.

<h3>The Perfect Doctor</h3>
<p>Well this one was just according to what i was studying at the moment. It really gave a Nip on what to do.</p>
<h3>The Nun 2</h3>
<p>I do like horror movies But this was paranormal. Especially when it included some holy symbols.</p>
<h3>Wrath of a man</h3>
<p>This was about a man, who avenged the death of his beloved son to a Cartel.
    My favorite actor, Jason statham was the antagonist in this.
